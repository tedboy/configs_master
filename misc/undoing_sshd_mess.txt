Undo any previous attempts to install the sshd service:
net stop sshd
cygrunsrv -R sshd
net user sshd /DELETE  # See note below
rm -R /etc/ssh*
mkpasswd -cl > /etc/passwd
mkgroup --local > /etc/group

# Run `net user` to find out if there’s any other such users that could have run sshd – example “sshd” or “cyg_server”. Delete these as well. Don’t delete any default Windows ones!
