2. Run cygwin as admin, and do 
	$ ssh-host-config

	You'll get the following query:
		(a) "Should privelege separation be used?" -> yes 
			(It’s on by default in standard installations of OpenSSH on other systems, so go ahead and say “yes” to the prompt)
		(b) "new local accound sshd?" -> yes
		(c) "Do you want to install sshd as a service?" -> yes
			(This will allow you to get SSH access regardless of whether or not Cygwin is currently running, which is what we want.)
		(d) "Enter the value of CYGWIN for the daemon" -> ntsec
		(e) "This script plans to use 'cyg_server'.  'cyg_server' will only be used by registered services.  Do you want to use a different name?" -> no
			(The default works well, so type “no” when it asks you if you want to use a different account name, although you can change this if you really like)
		(f) "Create new privileged user account 'cyg_server'?" -> yes
		(g) "Please enter the password" -> enter whatever password you like

3. After step2 is complete, run the following in cygwin to start the sshd service...then exit:
	$ net start sshd
	$ exit

4. Restart cygwin (normally, rather than as admin), and enter the following:
	$ ssh-user-config

	You'll get the following query:
		(a) " Shall I create a SSH2 RSA identity file for you?" -> yes
			(SSH2 is more secure, so that’s what I recommend to you)
		(b) "Enter passphrase" -> enter whatever password you like
		(c) "Do you want to use this identity to login to this machine?" -> yes
		(d) "Shall I create a SSH2 DSA identity file for you?" -> no
			(Next, you’ll be asked to create an SSH2 DSA ID file, if you want to use password-less access. I declined at this step)
	Say no for the remainder (SSH2 ECDSA identity file, SSH1 RSA identity file)

5. Enter the following in cygwin to test if the configuration worked out:
	$ ssh -v localhost # -v for "verbose", giving you all of the details of the process.

	Youl'll be asked if you want to continue connecting, so say "yes" and enter password at the prompt"
